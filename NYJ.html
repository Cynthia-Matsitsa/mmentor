    <div class="summary">
        <p>Black South Africans are divided  into tribes. Tribes have a  long history of conflict ,
           particularly between   the two dominant groups, the  Zulu and the Xhola. Zulu fighting 
           against European and invades are decimated. Christianity is forced on native  South Africa by Europeans. 
           Trevor's mother is a christian who takes her family to multiple churches every sunday. Church offers something 
           different and caters to a different racial demographic-mostly, white , black or mixed. Trevor's mother is criticized by 
           a minibus driver for traveling without a man.Trevor mother throws Trevor through the window of the bus and she jumps out herself.
           Trevor does not realize that her mother saved his life. Dutch colonists came to Calpe Town under British rule and gradually developed their own culture and language.
           Afrikaners  take over to stay in Johannesburg because it is illegal for black people to live within the city limits. Patricia gives birth to a mixed-race child with a Swiss man.
           Noah juxtaposes his mother's devoutness with his own pragmatic relationship with God, giving necessary information about his birthplace via a personal anecdote. When the Europeans 
           sought to remake South Africa according to their own vision, they used Christianity as a primary means of reshaping its people. Patricia’s Christian faith is as much a part of who 
           she is as her Xhosa heritage, though the former was imposed on her people by the government. Young Trevor points out that if it weren’t for the church, his family would not have been
           in such a dangerous situation in the first place. This proclamation highlights his critical thinking and foreshadows the businessman that he will become as a young man.Patricia looks
           to her faith for direction in every aspect of her life, but it is evident that she is not likewise beholden to the laws limiting South Africans. When she decides that she wants a child,
           she brings to the task the same perseverance and ability to circumvent the law that she used to achieve her professional goals. She knows the risk involved with having a mixed-race child, 
           but nonetheless persuades a Swiss man to give her one. Her pregnancy is the result of deliberate planning and is a testament to her resolve and powers of persuasion. Ironically, the same 
           level of devotion Patricia applies to the divine is seen in her devotion to navigating and evading human laws</p>
